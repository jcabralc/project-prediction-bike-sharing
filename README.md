> Data Science Academy - Data Science Formation - Course 1 - Project

This repository contains project files from the first [Data Science Academy]([https://datascienceacademy.com.br](https://www.datascienceacademy.com.br/)) [Data Scientist training course]([datascienceacademy.com.br/bundles?bundle_id=formacao-cientista-de-dados).

The project aims to forecast the demand for bikes.

As a plus, the [MLFlow framework ](https://www.mlflow.org/) was used to track and manage the various versions of the model.
